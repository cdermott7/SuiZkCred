# ZK Circuit WASM Files

This directory will contain the compiled WebAssembly files for our zero-knowledge circuit. 

For a complete implementation, we need to:
1. Compile our Circom circuit to WebAssembly
2. Generate a proving key and verification key
3. Add the WASM and keys to this directory
4. Use snarkjs in the browser to generate proofs

The implementation will use the browser-compatible version of snarkjs.
